## Getting started

### Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for this analysis.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

### Data

The data are available in the `data` folder:

-   `sales-taxes.csv`

-   `us-regions.csv`

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| message: false
sales_taxes <- read_csv("data/sales-taxes.csv")
us_regions <- read_csv("data/us-regions.csv")
```

And let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse
glimpse(sales_taxes)
glimpse(us_regions)
```

## Sales tax in swing states: `if_else`

Create new `swing_state` variable using `if_else`:

```{r}
#| label: mutate-if_else
list_of_swing_states <- c("Arizona", "Georgia", "Michigan", "Nevada", 
                          "North Carolina", "Pennsylvania", "Wisconsin")

sales_taxes <- sales_taxes |>
  mutate(
    swing_state = if_else(state %in% list_of_swing_states,
                          "Swing",
                          "Non-swing")) |>
  relocate(swing_state)

sales_taxes
```

Summarize to find the mean sales tax in each type of state:

```{r}
#| label: summarize-swing
sales_taxes |>
  group_by(swing_state) |>
  summarize(mean_state_tax = mean(state_tax_rate))
```

## Sales tax in coastal states: `case_when`

Create new `coast` variable using `case_when`:

```{r}
#| label: mutate-case_when

pacific_coast <- c("Alaska", "Washington", "Oregon", "California", "Hawaii")

atlantic_coast <- c(
  "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Georgia", "Florida", "Maine", "Maryland", 
  "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New York", 
  "North Carolina", "Rhode Island", "South Carolina", "Virginia"
)

sales_taxes <- sales_taxes |>
  mutate(
    coast = case_when(
      state %in% pacific_coast ~ "Pacific",
      state %in% atlantic_coast ~ "Atlantic",
      .default = "Neither"
    )
  ) |>
  relocate(coast)

sales_taxes
```

Summarize to find the mean sales tax in each type of state:

```{r}
#| label: summarize-coastal
sales_taxes |>
  group_by(coast) |>
  summarize(mean_state_tax = mean(state_tax_rate))
```

## Sales tax in US regions: joining

Join the sales tax data with region data and save the joined data frame as a new data frame, not overwriting either data frame that goes into the join.

```{r}
#| label: join
sales_taxes_regions <- sales_taxes |>
  full_join(us_regions, 
            by = join_by(state == state_name)) |>
  relocate(region)

sales_taxes_regions
```

Calculate the average sales tax of states in each region. What is surprising in the output?

```{r}
#| label: region-means-take-1
sales_taxes_regions |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarize(mean_state_tax = mean(state_tax_rate))
```

Identify the state with `NA` for region.

```{r}
#| label: identify-na
sales_taxes_regions |>
  filter(is.na(region)) |>
  select(state)
```

Apply a fix for the `NA` in region, and calculate the mean sales taxes for regions again. Display the results in ascending order of mean sales tax.

```{r}
#| label: region-means-take-2

sales_taxes_regions |>
  mutate(
    region = if_else(state == "District of Columbia", "Northeast", region)
  ) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarize(mean_state_tax = mean(state_tax_rate))
```
