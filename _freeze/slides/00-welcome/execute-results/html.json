There could be noise and mistakes. Then what?\n-   **Wisdom of crowds**: aggregating many imperfect guesses can do better than any one individual guess.\n\n## Hard skills\n\n-   GitHub repositories: cloning and pulling;\n-   Working with data in CSV format;\n-   Rendering a Quarto document to get PDFs that seamlessly integrate written text, code, and output;\n-   Using `ggplot` to build up visualizations in layers, like a cake.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Get ready\n\nYou will do all of these things on a weekly basis in this course.\n:::\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## This week's tasks\n\n-   Complete Lab 0\n    -   Computational setup\n    -   Getting to know you survey\n-   Read the syllabus and ask questions on Ed\n-   Complete readings and videos for next class\n-   Accept your invitation to the GitHub organization pronto!\n",
