## Communication

If you wish to ask content-related questions in writing, please do not do so via e-mail. Instead, please use the course discussion forum Ed Discussion. That way all members of the teaching team can see your question, and all students can benefit from the ensuing discussion. You are also encouraged to answer one another’s questions.

If you have questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, accommodations, etc), then please e-mail the instructor directly (john.zito\@duke.edu).

::: callout-note
You can ask questions anonymously on Ed. The teaching team will still know your identity, but your peers will not.

## Late work and extensions

No late work will be accepted for application exercises, exams, or projects. Labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. A 5% deduction will be applied for each 24-hour period during which the assignment is late.

If circumstances prevent you from completing a lab by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr. Mary Knox, before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide an explanation. This waiver may only be used once a semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.

If circumstances have a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know. They can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.

## Regrade requests

If you receive a graded assignment back, and you believe that some part of it was graded incorrectly, you may dispute the grade by submitting a [regrade request](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/21854736042253-Submitting-a-Regrade-Request) in Gradescope. Note the following:

-   You have one week after you receive a grade to submit a regrade request;
-   You should submit separate regrade requests for each question you wish to dispute, not a single catch-all request;
-   Requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect;
-   Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered;
-   Regrade requests are not a mechanism for asking for clarification on feedback. Those questions should be brought to office hours;
-   **No grades will be changed after the final exam has been administered on Tuesday, April 29**;

::: callout-warning
A regrade request can result in your grade going up, staying the same, or going down if we determine that, in fact, the original grader was too lenient.

## Attendance

For the most part, attendance is not strictly required. You are an adult, and you are free to live your life. The responsibility lies with us to make class meetings sufficiently engaging and informative that you choose to attend. Having said that, success in this class and regular attendance are probably highly positively correlated. Furthermore, regular lecture attendance is likely the path of least resistance toward earning full credit for the application exercises. Lastly, there are some aspects of the final project that will require you to attend your lab section so that you can convene with your teammates. 

### Lecture recording request

Lectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at the link below (!!!). Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.

## Accommodations

If you need accommodations for this class, you will need to register with the Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) and provide them with documentation related to your needs. SDAO will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact SDAO for more information: `sdao@duke.edu` or `access.duke.edu`.

## Collaboration

You are encouraged to discuss and help one another with the labs, but you should not share solutions (e.g. emailing a friend your code). All submitted work must be your own; You are forbidden from collaborating in any way on the exams; You are enthusiastically encouraged to collaborate with your teammates on all aspects of the final project.

## Use of outside resources, including AI
