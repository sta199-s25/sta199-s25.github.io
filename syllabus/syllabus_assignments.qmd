Your final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category              | Percentage |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Application exercises | 5%         |
| Labs                  | 15%        |
| Midterm Exam 1        | 20%        |
| Midterm Exam 2        | 20%        |
| Final exam            | 20%        |
| Final project         | 20%        |

Your final letter grade will be determined based on these thresholds:

| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A            | \>= 93             |
| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |
| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |
| B            | 83 - 86.99         |
| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |
| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |
| C            | 73 - 76.99         |
| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |
| D+           | 67 - 69.99         |
| D            | 63 - 66.99         |
| D-           | 60 - 62.99         |
| F            | \< 60              |

::: callout-warning
These thresholds will not change and will be applied exactly. This means that the final grades will not be curved, and a 92.99 will not be rounded up to an A.

## Application exercises (5%)

During most lectures, we will work through an *application exercise* (*AE*) together. This is essentially a guided mini-lab that shows you how to implement the concepts introduced that day. Note:

- AEs are due at 2PM ET on the day they are introduced;
- Submit an AE by pushing your work to your GitHub repo;
- AEs are graded for completion; you will receive full credit if you make a good faith attempt at all parts.s

Successful on-time completion of at least 70% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.

## Labs (15%)

Lowest dropped

## Midterm Exams (20% each)

-   In-class
-   Take-home

## Final Exam (20%)

On Tuesday April 29	we have our final exam from 9AM ET to 12PM ET. This exam will be cumulative, and it will have the same format as the in-class components of the midterm exams: sit-down, in-person, pencil-and-paper, with no technology, and with no outside resources apart from a note sheet of your creation (both sides of an 8.5' x 11' piece of paper). 

::: callout-note
If you do better on the final exam than you did on the in-class component of a midterm, we will replace your lowest in-class midterm exam score with your final exam score.

Your final exam score will replace your lowest in-class midterm score if it's higher

## Final project (20%)

We will assign you to groups of 4 or 5 within your lab. You will then select a dataset and do some stuff. The final product is a 5 minute video and a write-up
