Your final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category              | Percentage |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Application exercises | 5%         |
| Labs                  | 15%        |
| Midterm Exam 1        | 20%        |
| Midterm Exam 2        | 20%        |
| Final exam            | 20%        |
| Final project         | 20%        |

Your final letter grade will be determined based on these thresholds:

| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A            | \>= 93             |
| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |
| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |
| B            | 83 - 86.99         |
| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |
| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |
| C            | 73 - 76.99         |
| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |
| D+           | 67 - 69.99         |
| D            | 63 - 66.99         |
| D-           | 60 - 62.99         |
| F            | \< 60              |

::: callout-warning
These thresholds will not change and will be applied exactly. This means that the final grades will not be curved, and a 92.99 will not be rounded up to an A.
