## How do I export my assignment PDF from RStudio to upload to Gradescope?

Go to your *Files* tab, check the box next to the file you want to download, then click on the blue gear icon on the Files tab to reveal the drop down menu, and select *Export*... If you have selected multiple files to export, RStudio will zip them up into a single zip file for you. If you've selected just a single file, it will only download that. The downloaded file will go to wherever files you download off the internet goes on your computer (usually your Downloads folder).

## How can I submit my assignment to Gradescope?

The instructions for submitting your assignment to Gradescope can be found [here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_a_pdf). In a nutshell, you'll upload your PDF and them mark the page(s) where each question can be found. It's OK if a question spans multiple pages, just mark them all. It's also OK if a page includes multiple questions.
