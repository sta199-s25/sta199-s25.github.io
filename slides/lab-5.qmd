# Simple linear regression

## Question: how do we concisely summarize the association between two variables? {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

base <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Weight (1,000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per gallon (MPG)",
    title = "MPG vs. weights of cars"
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1.5, 5.5), ylim = c(10, 35))

base
```

## Answer: simple linear regression! {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

base <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Weight (1,000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per gallon (MPG)",
    title = "MPG vs. weights of cars"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1.5, 5.5), ylim = c(10, 35))

base
```

## Answer: simple linear regression! {.scrollable}

```{r}
mpg_wt_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

tidy(mpg_wt_fit)
```

$$
\widehat{mpg}=37.3 - 5.34\times weight.
$$

**Interpretations**

- We predict that a car weighing zero pounds will have 37.28 MPG on average (makes no sense);
- We predict that a 1000 pound increase in weight in associated with a 5.34 decrease in MGP, on average.

## Why do we care? Prediction!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

base +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkgray", linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 3.5, xend = 3.5, y = -Inf, yend = 18.5,
    color = "#FE5D26"
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -Inf, xend = 3.5, y = 18.5, yend = 18.5,
    color = "#FE5D26"
  )
```

## Why do we care? Prediction!

You can use the fitted model to generate predictions for yet-to-be-observed subjects:

```{r}
new_car <- tibble(
  wt = 3.5
)

predict(mpg_wt_fit, new_data = new_car)
```

# Part 1 of today's lab...

## Does increasing the minimum wage decrease employment? {.scrollable}

- This is a hotly debated question in economics and public policy;

- ECON 101 logic says that it might: if you make something more expensive (employing people), people do less of it.

- **What do the actual data say?**

## Classic study: Card and Krueger (1994 AER) {.scrollable}

- In 1992, NJ raised minimum wage. PA did not;

- Fast-food restaurants along the NJ/PA border are probably very similar. Maybe the only difference is the change in wage policy;

- So PA is like *control* and NJ is like the *treatment*;

- If we compare employment before and after the policy change, maybe we can give the observed differences a **causal** interpretation. The increase in minimum wage caused employment to go up, down, or stay the same;

- This is called a **natural experiment**. It's a kind of observational study where you get *very* lucky and "nature" does the experimental control for you.
