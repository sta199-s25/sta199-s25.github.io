Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nYou should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be considered plagiarism and treated as such.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting an LLM like ChatGPT\n\n\n\nHere are some general guidelines for citing AI-generated content. In this class, if you use something like ChatGPT to help you, you need to cite that by providing a direct link to the conversation you had with the bot, like this: https://chatgpt.com/share/677c4060-1d58-8008-8e47-5caa5556a825.

Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis lab assumes that you have already completed Lab 0.

It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\nClick on the green CODE button, select Use SSH (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you’ll see the text Clone with SSH).

Again, please make sure to have SSH highlighted under Clone when you copy the address.\nClick Create Project, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the Files pane in RStudio.\nClick lab-1.qmd to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\nThe top portion of your Quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human-friendly data representation for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\nOpen the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document.\nIf you get a popup window error, click “Try again”.\nExamine the rendered document and make sure your name is updated in the document.\n\n\n\nGo to the Git pane in RStudio. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. If you have rendered the document, you should also see its output, a PDF file, listed there.\n\n\nClick on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff.\nThis shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\n\n\nIf you’re happy with these changes, prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository.\n\nFirst, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare.\nNext, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “Updated author name”) in the Commit message box.\nFinally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration (e.g., restoring a previous version of your document).\nIn the first few assignments, we will tell you exactly when to commit and, in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses, we will let you make these decisions.\n\n\n\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\n\nIn the Git pane, click on Push.\nThen, make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo in your browser and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub, and you’re good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you don’t see your update, go back to Step 4. Remember that in order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged (checked boxes) your commit (with a commit message) to be pushed and then click on Push.\n\n\n\nIn this lab we will work with the tidyverse package, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a “tidy” way.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nRun the code cell by clicking on the green triangle (play) button for the code cell labeled load-packages. This loads the package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) be accessible from your Console.\nThen, render the document which loads this package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) be available for other code cells in your Quarto document.\n\n\nThe tidyverse is a meta-package.

    "text": "Part 1 - Let’s take a trip to the Midwest!\nWe will use the midwest data frame for this lab. It is part of the ggplot2 R package, so the midwest data set is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package.\nThe data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States.\nBecause the data set is part of the ggplot2 package, you can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing ?midwest in the Console or searching for midwest in the Help pane.\nQuestion 1\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties using a histogram with geom_histogram() with four separate binwidths: a binwidth of 100, a binwidth of 1,000, a binwidth of 10,000, and a binwidth of 100,000. For example, you can create the first plot with:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Population density\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Population density of Midwestern counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Binwidth = 100\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to make four different histograms. Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for each of your plots. Then, comment on which binwidth is most appropriate for these data and why.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 1”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 2\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties again, this time using a boxplot with geom_boxplot(). Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot. Then, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn describing a distribution, make sure to mention shape, center, spread, and any unusual observations.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 2”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 3\nUse geom_point to create a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (percbelowpoverty on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (percollege on the x-axis), where the color and shape of points are determined by state. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. First, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them. Then, comment on whether you can identify how this relationship varies across states.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 3”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 4\nNow, let’s examine the relationship between the same two variables, once again using different colors and shapes to represent each state, and using a separate plot for each state, i.e., with faceting with facet_wrap(). In addition to points (geom_point()), represent the data with a smooth curve fit to the data with geom_smooth(), with the argument se = FALSE. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. Which plot do you prefer - this plot or the plot in Question 3? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nse = FALSE removes the confidence bands around the line. These bands show the uncertainty around the smooth curve. We’ll discuss uncertainty around estimates later in the course and bring these bands back then.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 4”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 5\nRecreate the plot below, and then give it a title. Then, identify at least one county that is a clear outlier in Wisconsin (WI) by name. You can use the data viewer to identify them interactively, you do not have to write code. Comment on the population composition of this county by investigating the percentage of other races living there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 reference for themes will be helpful in determining the theme.\nThe size of the points is 2.\nThe transparency (alpha) of the points is 0.5.\nYou can put line breaks in labels with \\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward. We keep repeating this because it’s important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you’re following along with the version control instructions.",

    "text": "Part 3 - Potpourri graded for a good faith effort\nQuestion 8\nOne of the key reasons we care about data science and statistics in the first place is because they can help us make decisions under uncertainty. For example:\n\nWhen we save for retirement, we have to make a decision about what asset classes to invest in (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc) and in what proportions. We want to make the most stable and lucrative choice possible, accounting for the fact that we are uncertain about how the assets will ultimately perform. Data on past asset performance may help guide this decision;\nWhen insurance companies sell policies, they have to decide who to sell to and what sized premium to charge. They face uncertainty about how many policies will ultimately result in a claim (if it’s everyone, they’re ruined). In order to navigate this environment, they employ armies of actuaries to study historical data and help make decisions about profit, loss, and risk of ruin;\nGood barbecue cannot be made-to-order. A restaurant has to start preparing in the morning, before they know for certain how many folks will show up that day. If they prepare too little, they have to turn a lot of folks away and forfeit their money. If they prepare too much, it can go to waste. So a decision must be made under uncertainty, and it can be guided by historical data on demand, as it varies over the week and the year and during holidays and special events;\nThe manager of a presidential campaign must decide how to allocate the campaign’s resources to different states, counties, neighborhoods, types of media, etc. But these decisions are made before they know how the voters will ultimately behave, and so they try to resolve this uncertainty by analyzing all sorts of data: polling, prediction markets, social media sentiment, economic indicators, historical trends, etc.\nYou darn Duke students must decide what time you’re going to grab lunch at WU, subject to uncertainty about how long the lines will be. When you first matriculate, you might get burned a few times because you have no experience to base this decision on. By your senior year, you’ve accumulated a lot of data about the good and bad times at the different vendors, and how these vary across the days of the week and seasons of the year.\n\nYou get the idea. Now it’s your turn. Write a few paragraph describing an example from your everyday life where you have to make a decision under uncertainty (obviously, don’t recycle one of the examples above). What’s the decision? What are the sources of uncertainty? What is your decision-making process? What data, if it were available, could you consult to resolve some of this uncertainty and help you meet your objective?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t break my heart.\n\n\n\nThis is graded for completion, but JZ will read all of them. I am not interested in an example from ChatGPT’s everyday life where it has to make a decision under uncertainty. I want to know about you.\n\n\nQuestion 9\nData science is the process of turning messy, incomplete, imperfect data into knowledge, and statistics studies how we can quantify our uncertainty about that knowledge. To illustrate these ideas, we played a game on the first day of class; you were given data of various kinds about a celebrity (names vs pictures, clear pictures vs noisy ones), and you were asked to answer a simple question with a quantitative answer: how old is the person? The results of this exercise are memorialized in the lecture slides from that day, and I summarized some of the high-level lessons here.\nWrite a paragraph or two summarizing another lesson that we can learn from this game. It can be a generic, high-level lesson about the practice of data science and stats, like the ones I listed. It can be a lesson about the application itself that you took away from reviewing the substantive results. Or, you can cast your mind back to when you were guessing, and you can describe and evaluate your guessing process with the benefit of hindsight. What factors were you weighing and/or neglecting? Did you learn anything that could make you a better age-guesser in the future?\nAs you ponder this, note that you have access to the complete dataset of everyone’s guesses. Feel free to play around with it.\nQuestion 10\nDid you select your pages on Gradescope? You don’t need to write an answer for this question, if you select your pages when you upload your lab to Gradescope, you’ll get full points on this question. Otherwise, you’ll get a 0 on this question.2\nQuestion 11\nRecommend some music for us to listen to while we grade this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNot worth any points, but still important.",
