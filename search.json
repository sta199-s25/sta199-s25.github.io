Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nYou should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be considered plagiarism and treated as such.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting an LLM like ChatGPT\n\n\n\nHere are some general guidelines for citing AI-generated content. In this class, if you use something like ChatGPT to help you, you need to cite that by providing a direct link to the conversation you had with the bot, like this: https://chatgpt.com/share/677c4060-1d58-8008-8e47-5caa5556a825.

    "text": "This lab will introduce you to the course computing workflow. The main goal is to reinforce our demo of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface, commonly referred to as an integrated development environment or an IDE, for short.\n\n\nAn additional goal is to reinforce Git and GitHub, the version control, web hosting, and collaboration systems that we will be using throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).\n\n\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis lab assumes that you have already completed Lab 0. If you have not, please\n\ngo back and do that first before proceeding and\nlet your TA know as they will need to set up a Lab 1 repository for you before you can complete this lab.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the lab, you will…\n\nBe familiar with the workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub\nGain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto\nPractice version control using Git and GitHub\nBe able to create data visualizations using ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nGo to https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers and login with your Duke NetID and Password.\nClick STA198-199 under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n\nBelow are the components of the RStudio IDE.\n\nBelow are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.\n\n\n\nGo to the course organization at github.com/sta199-s25 organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix lab-1. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\nClick on the green CODE button, select Use SSH (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you’ll see the text Clone with SSH). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\nIn RStudio, go to File ➛ New Project ➛Version Control ➛ Git.\nCopy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box Repository URL. Again, please make sure to have SSH highlighted under Clone when you copy the address.\nClick Create Project, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the Files pane in RStudio.\nClick lab-1.qmd to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\nThe top portion of your Quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human-friendly data representation for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\nOpen the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document.\nIf you get a popup window error, click “Try again”.\nExamine the rendered document and make sure your name is updated in the document.\n\n\n\nGo to the Git pane in RStudio.

    "text": "Part 1 - Let’s take a trip to the Midwest!\nWe will use the midwest data frame for this lab. It is part of the ggplot2 R package, so the midwest data set is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package.\nThe data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States.\nBecause the data set is part of the ggplot2 package, you can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing ?midwest in the Console or searching for midwest in the Help pane.\nQuestion 1\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties using a histogram with geom_histogram() with four separate binwidths: a binwidth of 100, a binwidth of 1,000, a binwidth of 10,000, and a binwidth of 100,000. For example, you can create the first plot with:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Population density\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Population density of Midwestern counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Binwidth = 100\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to make four different histograms. Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for each of your plots. Then, comment on which binwidth is most appropriate for these data and why.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 1”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 2\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties again, this time using a boxplot with geom_boxplot(). Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot. Then, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn describing a distribution, make sure to mention shape, center, spread, and any unusual observations.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 2”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 3\nUse geom_point to create a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (percbelowpoverty on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (percollege on the x-axis), where the color and shape of points are determined by state. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. First, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them. Then, comment on whether you can identify how this relationship varies across states.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 3”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 4\nNow, let’s examine the relationship between the same two variables, once again using different colors and shapes to represent each state, and using a separate plot for each state, i.e., with faceting with facet_wrap(). In addition to points (geom_point()), represent the data with a smooth curve fit to the data with geom_smooth(), with the argument se = FALSE. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. Which plot do you prefer - this plot or the plot in Question 3? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nse = FALSE removes the confidence bands around the line. These bands show the uncertainty around the smooth curve. We’ll discuss uncertainty around estimates later in the course and bring these bands back then.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 4”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 5\nRecreate the plot below, and then give it a title. Then, identify at least one county that is a clear outlier in Wisconsin (WI) by name. You can use the data viewer to identify them interactively, you do not have to write code. Comment on the population composition of this county by investigating the percentage of other races living there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 reference for themes will be helpful in determining the theme.\nThe size of the points is 2.\nThe transparency (alpha) of the points is 0.5.\nYou can put line breaks in labels with \\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward. We keep repeating this because it’s important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you’re following along with the version control instructions.",

    "text": "Part 3 - Potpourri graded for a good faith effort\nQuestion 8\nOne of the key reasons we care about data science and statistics in the first place is because they can help us make decisions under uncertainty. For example:\n\nWhen we save for retirement, we have to make a decision about what asset classes to invest in (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc) and in what proportions. We want to make the most stable and lucrative choice possible, accounting for the fact that we are uncertain about how the assets will ultimately perform. Data on past asset performance may help guide this decision;\nWhen insurance companies sell policies, they have to decide who to sell to and what sized premium to charge. They face uncertainty about how many policies will ultimately result in a claim (if it’s everyone, they’re ruined). In order to navigate this environment, they employ armies of actuaries to study historical data and help make decisions about profit, loss, and risk of ruin;\nGood barbecue cannot be made-to-order. A restaurant has to start preparing in the morning, before they know for certain how many folks will show up that day. If they prepare too little, they have to turn a lot of folks away and forfeit their money. If they prepare too much, it can go to waste. So a decision must be made under uncertainty, and it can be guided by historical data on demand, as it varies over the week and the year and during holidays and special events;\nThe manager of a presidential campaign must decide how to allocate the campaign’s resources to different states, counties, neighborhoods, types of media, etc. But these decisions are made before they know how the voters will ultimately behave, and so they try to resolve this uncertainty by analyzing all sorts of data: polling, prediction markets, social media sentiment, economic indicators, historical trends, etc.\nYou darn Duke students must decide what time you’re going to grab lunch at WU, subject to uncertainty about how long the lines will be. When you first matriculate, you might get burned a few times because you have no experience to base this decision on. By your senior year, you’ve accumulated a lot of data about the good and bad times at the different vendors, and how these vary across the days of the week and seasons of the year.\n\nYou get the idea. Now it’s your turn. Write a few paragraph describing an example from your everyday life where you have to make a decision under uncertainty (obviously, don’t recycle one of the examples above). What’s the decision? What are the sources of uncertainty? What is your decision-making process? What data, if it were available, could you consult to resolve some of this uncertainty and help you meet your objective?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t break my heart.\n\n\n\nThis is graded for completion, but JZ will read all of them. I am not interested in an example from ChatGPT’s everyday life where it has to make a decision under uncertainty. I want to know about you.\n\n\nQuestion 9\nData science is the process of turning messy, incomplete, imperfect data into knowledge, and statistics studies how we can quantify our uncertainty about that knowledge. To illustrate these ideas, we played a game on the first day of class; you were given data of various kinds about a celebrity (names vs pictures, clear pictures vs noisy ones), and you were asked to answer a simple question with a quantitative answer: how old is the person? The results of this exercise are memorialized in the lecture slides from that day, and I summarized some of the high-level lessons here.\nWrite a paragraph or two summarizing another lesson that we can learn from this game. It can be a generic, high-level lesson about the practice of data science and stats, like the ones I listed. It can be a lesson about the application itself that you took away from reviewing the substantive results. Or, you can cast your mind back to when you were guessing, and you can describe and evaluate your guessing process with the benefit of hindsight. What factors were you weighing and/or neglecting? Did you learn anything that could make you a better age-guesser in the future?\nAs you ponder this, note that you have access to the complete dataset of everyone’s guesses. Feel free to play around with it.\nQuestion 10\nDid you select your pages on Gradescope? You don’t need to write an answer for this question, if you select your pages when you upload your lab to Gradescope, you’ll get full points on this question. Otherwise, you’ll get a 0 on this question.2\nQuestion 11\nRecommend some music for us to listen to while we grade this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNot worth any points, but still important.",

    "text": "Part 2\nBack to the Midwest!\nIn this part, you will revisit and build on some of your findings from Lab 1, where you explored the midwest data frame. Remember that this data frame is bundled with the ggplot2 package and is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package. As a refresher, the data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States. You can read the documentation for the data set, including variable definitions, by typing ?midwest in the Console or searching for midwest in the Help pane.\nQuestion 3\nCalculate the number of counties in each state and display your results in descending order of number of counties. Which state has the highest number of counties, and how many? Which state has the lowest number, and how many?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe number of counties in a state can change over time, so the values you see in this output may not be true today.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 3”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 4\nWhile two counties in a given state can’t have the same name, some county names might be shared across states. A classmate says “Look at that, there is a county called ___ in each state in this dataset!” In a single pipeline, discover all counties that could fill in the blanks. Your response should be a data frame with only the county names that could fill in the blank and the number of times they appear in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will want to use the filter() function in your answer, which requires a logical condition to describe what you want to filter for. For example, filter(x &gt; 2) means filter for values of x greater than 2, and filter(y &lt;= 3) means filter for values of y less than or equal to 3.\nThe table below is a summary of logical operators and how to articulate them in R.\n\n\noperator\ndefinition\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nexactly equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\nx & y\n\nx AND y\n\n\n\n\nx | y\n\n\nx OR y\n\n\n\nis.na(x)\ntest if x is NA\n\n\n\n!is.na(x)\ntest if x is not NA\n\n\n\nx %in% y\ntest if x is in y\n\n\n\n!(x %in% y)\ntest if x is not in y\n\n\n\n!x\nnot x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 4”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 5\nReturn to the following box plot of population densities where you were asked to identify at least one outlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this question, we want you to revisit this box plot and identify the counties described in each section.\na. The counties with a population density higher than 25,000. Your code must use the filter() function.\nb. The county with the highest population density. Your code must use the max() function.\nAnswer using a single data wrangling pipeline for each part. Your response should be a data frame with five columns: county name, state name, population density, total population, and area, in this order. If your response has multiple rows, the data frame should be arranged in descending order of population density.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 5”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 6\nIn Lab 1 you were also asked to describe the distribution of population densities. The following is one acceptable description that touches on the shape, center, and spread of this distribution. Calculate the values that should go into the blanks.\n\nThe distribution of population density of counties is unimodal and extremely right-skewed. A typical Midwestern county has population density of ____ people per unit area. The middle 50% of the counties have population densities between ___ to ___ people per unit area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThink about which measures of center and spread are appropriate for skewed distributions.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 6”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 7\nAnother visualization from Lab 1 was the following, which showed the proportion of urban counties in each state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate these proportions in a single data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember, you’ll first need to create a new variable called metro which takes on the value Yes if the value of inmetro is 1, and No otherwise. You can refer to Lab 1 if you need a refresher on how to do this.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 7”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 8\nReturn to the following scatter plot of percentage below poverty vs. percentage of people with a college degree, where the color and shape of points are determined by state where you were asked to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. In a single pipeline, identify the observations marked in the orange square in the upper left corner. Your answer should be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\nb. In a single pipeline, identify the observations marked in the red square in the plot above. Your answer should again be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\nc. Bring your answers from part (a) and part (b) together! In a single pipeline, and a single filter() statement, identify the observations marked in the red and orange square in the plot above. Your answer should again be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\nd. Create a new variable in midwest called potential_outlier. This variable should take on the value:\n\nYes if the point is one the ones you identified in part (c), i.e., one of the points marked in the squares in the plot above.\nNo otherwise.\n\nThen, display the updated midwest data frame, with county, state, percentage below poverty, percentage college educated, potential_outlier as the selected variables, arranged in descending order of potential_outlier.\ne. Recreate the visualization above, i.e., a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty vs. the percentage of people with a college degree. However, color the points by the newly created potential_outlier variable instead of the state.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 8”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 9\na. In a single pipeline, calculate the total population for each state and save the resulting data frame as state_population. Then, display the data frame, state_population, in descending order of total population.\nb. Then, in a separate pipeline, calculate the proportion of the total population in each state. Once again, display the results in descending order of proportion of population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn answering parts (a) and (b), you’ll create two new variables, one for the total population and the other for the proportion of total proportion. Make sure to give them “reasonable” names – short but evocative.\n\n\nc. Which Midwestern state is most populous, and what percent of the Midwest population lives there? Which is the least populous and what percent lives there?\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 9”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 10\nCalculate the average percentage below poverty for each state and save the resulting data frame as state_poverty with the columns state and mean_percbelowpoverty.\nThen, in a new pipeline, display the state_poverty data frame in ascending order of mean_percbelowpoverty. Which state has the lowest average percentage below poverty across its counties? Which state has the highest average percentage below poverty across its counties?\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 10”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward."
